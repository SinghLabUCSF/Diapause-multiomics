## Identify paralogs and their duplication timeing in killifish and other vertebrates

* [1_organisms](1_organisms)  
   Species used for the analysis. We used 3 groups of species inclusing 71, 31 and 13 species. These groups were chosen to preserve critical branching points in vertebrate evolution.   
   
* [4_sequences](4_sequences)  
   Generate automated FTP links and download the sequences for all the genomes.   
   
   
> Orthofinder was run using 3 species groups and results were parsed and analyzed separately.   
   
   
* [5_orthofinder_Results_Aug04_71spp](5_orthofinder_Results_Aug04_71spp)   
   Process 71 species group.
      
* [5_orthofinder_Results_Aug11_31spp](5_orthofinder_Results_Aug11_31spp)   
   Process 31 species group.

* [5_orthofinder_Results_Aug12_13spp](5_orthofinder_Results_Aug12_13spp)   
   Process 13 species group.

* [5_Ensembl_duplicates](5_Ensembl_duplicates)   
   Process resuts from duplication time estimation directly from Ensembl.

* [6_combine_paralog_singleton_dNdS](6_combine_paralog_singleton_dNdS)   
   Get evolutionary rate estimates for paralogs.
