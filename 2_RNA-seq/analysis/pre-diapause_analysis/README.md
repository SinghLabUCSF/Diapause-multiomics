## Compare pre-diapause RNA-seq across species

Datasets used: 

* N. furzeri, A. australe and A. striatum: Pre-diapause RNA-seq sequenced in this study.
* A. limnaeus: Pre-dipauase RNA-seq from Wagner et al. for mid somitogenesis at 30C.
* Medaka: Mid-somitogenesis stage (Stage 16).
* Zebrafish: Mid-somitogenesis stages (bud [10HPF], 12 HPF and 16 HPF).

#### Processing 

1. Each species is processed and normalized separately to generate RNA-seq counts.   
2. Base on high-confidence orthologs, then orthologous-paralog pairs are generated and used for plotting.
